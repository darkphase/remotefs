.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBrfsd\fR may work in two modes:
.SS Just file server
.PP
For this mode all users may be authenticated by IP-address or login and password.
All users will be able to read files in exported directory and write to files
until "ro" option isn't specified for this export.
.PP
\fBrfsd\fR worker process will be running with privileges of user (and group) 
specified by \fI-u\fR and \fI-g\fR options (root by default). Or worker process 
user and group may be overriden by specifying options \fI"user="\fR and 
\fI"group="\fR for single export.
.SS UGO compatible mode
.PP
For this mode, \fBrfsd will login user\fR to OS. It's like remote shell, but without
actual shell, just file access. To enable this mode, set option \fI"ugo"\fR for 
export(s).
.PP
Options \fI-u\fR and \fI-g\fR are ineffective if \fI"ugo"\fR option is specified. As 
well, as options \fI"user="\fR, \fI"group="\fR and \fI"ro"\fR in exports file.
.PP
You have to create system users with the same names as remotefs users. rfsd will
not use system passwords database for authentication, it will use rfspasswd database 
instead. 
.PP
In this mode users could use chown and chmod commands to set access right. Remote and
local systems are should be synced for this mode to work fully. In other case,
server may refuse to set owner if it isn't aware of specified user or group and
remotefs client may report wrong owner or group. 
.PP
See \fBrfs\fR(1) for description of side effects of unsynced systems at client's side.
