Porting of rfs_nss shall not be complicated, The code is, as far
as possible OS independent.

The first step for porting is to create the file mk/`uname`.mk
and to have correct values assigned to the used variable.
See for this the allready provided OS-specific makefiles.

At the end of the OS-specific Makefiles, the variables CLIENT,
SERVER and OTHER contain the name of the components which can be
compiled.

If you can't compile the programs, there is possibly a problem
with the include files, some other file need to be included.

Rfs_nss can't be ported to all systems.
- Darwin don't support the nss as under normal POSIX systems and
  the code for rfs_nss must be completly new.
  The only program which make sense is rfs_nss_rem and this is
  the only programm which can be compiled for Mac OS X
- QNX is for embedded systems and don't need the nss component
  as for Linux openSolaris and BSD systems. Darwin (Mac OS X)
  is very different and porting this will result in a new development.

For System which support nss, you must write a wrapper in order
to call the different nss functions supported by rfs_nss.

The file rfs_nss_server.c contain at the top some include directive
and defined which are OS related.
The wrapper code shall be included st the bottom of rfs_nss_server.c
