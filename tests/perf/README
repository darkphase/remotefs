Tests for transfer speed
------------------------

The application perf don't reflect exactly the performance of
the transfer of file.

Perf create a local file copy it to the server and copy it
back.

For filesystems which made an intensive use of caching the speed
will seem to be very big and this is not what you will reach if
you load the file on the server for the first time.

In order go get more valueable data you must make sure that
no file datas are cached on the client.
In order to do so, you should unmount and mount again the
file system.
The utility remount is a very simplistic application which
must be run as root, This can be do as follow:

$ make remount
$ sudo -s
# chown root:root remount
# chmod 5755 remount
# exit

You may also use su on systems for which su is not disabled.

The command passed to remount may be a script which could look
as follow

------------------------------
# File nfs
# Purpose umount and mount again nfs
umount /mnt/nfs
mount /mnt/nfs
------------------------------

You can pass the following argument to perf in order to remount
the filesystem at place which are important:

-r "./remount ./nsf"

Don't forgot to make the script executable.

WARNING: remount is only for test and shall be removed after the
tests are completed. Anyone may become root while using remount!

Use of perf:
------------

- Copy one 9 MBytes file to the server and back to the client

perf copy -d testdir -M 8m

- Copy  files with size of 1, 2, 3 and 4 MNytes to the server and back to the client

perf copy -d testdir -m 0 -s 1M -M 4M

- Copy files from client to server and back beginning with a size of 1 KBytes.
  incresase size by 2 after each copy and copy back. Limit the maximum number
  of files to 1024 and the maximun size for all files to 256 MBytes

perf copy -d testdir -m 1k -s 2x -M 256M -f 1024 -t 256M


- Copy files as previous example but perform n copy in parallel.

perf copy -d testdir -m 1k -s 2x -M 256M -f 1024 -t 256M -n 2
