.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBrfsd\fR may work in two modes:
.SS Just file server
.PP
For this mode all users may be authenticated by IP-address or login and password. 
All users will be able to read files in exported directory and write to files unless 
there is an "ro" option specified for this export.
.PP
\fBrfsd\fR worker process will be running with privileges of user (and group) 
specified by \fI-u\fR and \fI-g\fR options (root by default). Alternatively, worker 
process user and group may be overridden by specifying \fI"user="\fR and 
\fI"group="\fR options for a particular export.
.SS UGO compatibility mode
.PP
For this mode, \fBrfsd will log the user\fR into the server's OS. It's like remote 
shell, but without the actual shell, just for file access. To enable this mode, 
set option \fI"ugo"\fR for export(s).
.PP
If \fIugo\fR option is specified, \fI-u\fR and \fI-g\fR options in rsfd command line 
as well as \fI"user="\fR, \fI"group="\fR and \fI"ro"\fR options in exports file are 
ignored.
.PP
You need to create system users with the same names as remotefs users. However, rfsd 
will not use system passwords database for authentication, it will use rfspasswd 
database instead.
.PP
In this mode users could use chown and chmod commands to set access rights. Remote 
and local systems should be synced for this mode to work fully. Otherwise the server 
may refuse to set the owner if it isn't aware of the specified user or group and the 
client may report the wrong owner or group.
.PP
See \fBrfs\fR(1) for description of side effects of unsynced systems at client's side.
.SH "SECURITY NOTES"
.PP
Official recommendation for remotefs is to keep it away from untrusted networks. You 
normally setup rfsd to listen on a local network. If you absolutely need to use it 
over the Internet, you should at least firewall the connection with a specific 
IP-address. 
.PP
Please consider this advice seriously. 
.PP
BTW, rfsd will warn you about listening on an interface that is not local and will 
refuse to run until -q option is provided, or a local interface is specified.
