\fIhost\fR can be either server's host name or its IP address. \fIremote_path\fR 
is the path of the directory which is exported on the server. If server's exports 
file contains the line: \fI/exports/alice alice ()\fR then \fIremote_path\fR must 
be \fI/exports/alice\fR.
.PP
\fI\-o username=NAME\fR User name for rsfd. If UGO option is enabled for a 
particular export, this name should also be registered in server's user 
login base.
.PP
\fI\-o password=FILENAME\fR This plain-text file must contain the password for 
accessing the remote directory.
.PP
\fBNote that for security reasons this file should only be readable by its owner.\fR
.PP
The command line for mounting the remoteresource may look like:
.PP
\fIrfs -o username=alice,password=./pwd-home 192.168.1.2:/exports/alice ./mnt/\fR
.PP
There are also a lot of options which are offered by FUSE. FUSE has been built for 
many kinds of file systems and not every option will work with remotefs. Some of the 
FUSE options may result in errors or decrease the performance of remotefs.
.PP
However, \fI-okernel_cache\fR may increase transfer speed for remotefs.
.PP
Please avoid usage of \fI-odirect_io\fR as it will most likely lead to errors.
.SS "Remarks"
.PP
\fBSolaris:\fP In order to mount remote directory with remotefs you must have FUSE
access rights, see user_attr(4). This can be done by setting the 
"FUSE File System Management" rights with the user and group administrations tools,
.PP
\fBFreeBSD:\fP Mounting of FUSE based file system is allowed if vfs.usermount is
set to 1 via the sysctl command. This can be configured within the file
/etc/sysctl.conf (add the line "vfs.usermount=1"). You can unmount your private
mountpoint with the umount command.
.SH "SECURITY NOTES"
.PP
Official recommendation for remotefs is to keep it away from untrusted networks. 
.PP
Please consider this advice seriously. 
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.PP
If /etc/passwd and /etc/group file on the client and the server are not identical, 
the displayed name for unknown user and group will default to nobody (username), 
nogroup or name of the primary group of the user on the client. In this case, 
access rights may differ from the ones reported by remotefs.
.PP
This actually means that remotefs may not know the real user or group the file 
belongs to, but in any case access is controlled by the server with its security 
setup.
.PP
For example:
.PP
The server has a file that belongs to remotefs:remotefs. There is neither a 
"remotefs" user nor a group on the client, so this file may be reported as 
nobody:nogroup. Even if a client's user could access nobody's files on his system, 
server won't allow it, since the real owner of this file is the "remotefs" user.
