<p>		
remotefs is a network file system designed for use with home NAS. Simple 
to use, few dependencies, reasonable security, completely in user space.
</p>

<p>
The reasons i've decided to make it are a) samba isn't working for me 
at all b) NFS is not working well for me c) sshfs is great, but not 
very fast. So if you have troubles with samba and NFS (as I do), then
you may be interested in remotefs.
</p>

<p>	
It is provided with packages for i386/amd64 
<a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>-based systems, 
i386/amd64 <a href="http://redhat.com">Redhat</a>-based systems, 
one package for <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>-based systems
(server only). See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotefs/files/remotefs/">downloads</a>
section for the list of available packages. Build scripts are available
in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/remotefs/git/ci/master/tree/">Git</a>,
so you could make packages for your plastform(s) if you wish so.
</p>

<h3>Note about OpenWrt packages</h3>

<p>
I've built only package for hardware i have, so it is guranteed to work.
You might refer to OpenWrt trunk
<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">snapshots</a> for
updated packages.

<a name="howitworks"><h2>How it works</h2></a>

<h3>Just file server</h3>

<p>	
remotefs only translates the filesystem from remote host to your local
host. To do that, the original file-owning user on the remote host is
substituted by the local host user who has actually mounted an export
via remotefs.
</p>

<p>
This is may look too simple, but this is enough for tasks performed
by my home NAS. My NAS is single-user and i'm always running remotefs
as root on LAN interface (invisible from outside network). So translating
root's files' permissions to alex's permissions works just fine and so
it will work fine for any other NAS user.
</p>

<p>
But if you need something more complex, like transferring a home
directory from a remote host, you may define users on a per-export basis.
After an export is mounted on the local host, remotefs will lower
its privileges to specified user (and/or group) and gain this user’s
privileges on the remote host. Since home directory usually has its
user's permissions, you should not have any permission problems with
this translation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Main rfsd process still needs to be run as root to do chroot()
properly.</b>
</p>

<h3>UGO-compatible mode</h3>

<p>
If "ugo" (UGO stands for User-Group-Other) option is specified for
some export, rfsd will log the user into the server’s OS. It's like
remote shell, but without the actual shell, just for file access.
</p>

<p>
In this mode server will report real files' owner and group. See MAN
pages (<a href="rfsd.8.html"><b>rfsd</b></a>(8), 
<a href="rfs.1.html"><b>rfs</b></a>(1)) for possible side-effects.
rfsd's option -u is ignored for this mode.
</p>

<a name="security"><h2>Security notes</h2></a>

<p>
Official recomendation for remotefs is to keep it away from
untrusted networks. You normally setup rfsd to listen to local network.
If you absolutely need to use it over the Internet, you should at
least firewall the connection with a specific IP-address.
</p>

<p>
Please consider this advice seriously. remotefs security is reasonable
for LAN, not bulletproof.
</p>

<p>
BTW, rfsd will warn you about listening to interface that is not local
and will refuse to run until -q option is provided, or local interface
specified.
