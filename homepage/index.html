		remotefs is a network file system designed for use with NAS. Simple to use, few dependencies, reasonable security, completely in user space.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		The reasons i've decided to make it are a) samba isn't working for me at all b) NFS is not working well for me c) sshfs is great, but not very fast.
		I﻿n comparison with sshfs, performance on my hardware has improved roughly four times (with read/write cache enabled). 
		So if you have trouble with samba and NFS (as I do), then you may be interested in remotefs.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		It is provided with packages for i386 Debian-based systems and partialy for MIPSEL Kamikaze-based systems (<a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>). 
		See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=229928">downloads</a> section for the list of available packages.
		Build scripts are available in SVN (<a href="https://remotefs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remotefs">https://remotefs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remotefs</a>), so you could make packages for your platform(s) if you wish so.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<strong>I'm currently looking for people who could review the code and point out security issues. 
		Any help would be appreciated.</strong>

		<br/><br/>
		
		How-to:
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<strong>Starting the server:</strong> <code>/etc/init.d/rfsd start</code><br/><br/>
		(do not forget to put your exports into /etc/rfs-exports and set passwords with rfspasswd utility (if you need them)).

		<br/><br/>
		
		Available options for rfsd:
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<code>-h 			show help<br/>
		-a [address]		listen for connections on specified address<br/>
		-p [port number]	listen for connections on specified port<br/>
		-u [username]		worker process be running with privileges of this user</code><br/><br/>
		
		Make note that rfsd with -u option will get filesystem permissions of specified user and it still needs to be initially run by root to properly do chroot(). 
		After mounting of export (chroot()), process's user id will be changed to the one specified with -u option. 
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		Default values for these options are specified in the /etc/init.d/rfsd script.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<strong>Exports file:</strong>
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		The file is NFS-like, except there is no subnet mask for ip-addresses. 
		Export example: <code>/tmp 127.0.0.1, alex, 10.0.0.2 (ro)</code><br/>
		"ro" (read-only) is actually the only supported option for the export.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<strong>Client setup:</strong>
		
		<br/><br/>

		Mounting export: <code>rfs 10.0.0.1:/mnt/usb/store begemoth/</code>
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		It is NFS/sshfs like. If you are not familiar with it, here is its format: “rfs host:export_name mount_point”. Host is ip-address or host name, export name is the string from exports file, mount_point  has the same meaning as in the any other mount operation.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		Available remotefs options are:
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		<code>-o username=name        auth username<br/>
	    -o rd_cache=0           disable read cache<br/>
	    -o wr_cache=0           disable write cache<br/>
	    -o rdwr_cache=0         disable read/write cache<br/>
	    -o password=filename    filename with password for auth<br/>
	    -o port=server_port     port which the server is listening to</code>
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		Since version 0.9, both read and write caches are enabled by default. You may use options -ord_cache=0, -owr_cache=0, and -ordwr_cache=0 to disable read cache, write cache or both.
		Example: <code>rfs 10.0.0.1:/mnt/usb/store begemoth/ -ordwr_cache=0</code>

		
		<br/><br/>
		
		Read and write caches are supposed to improve read/write performance.
		I've managed to get more than 2.5Mb/s both ways on my hardware (WL-500gP). 
		However, this performance improvement is good for large files only. 
		An application which writes small amounts of data to many files will not experience a performance increase.
		
		<br/><br/>
		
		You may also specify other FUSE option(s). 
		See <code>rfs -h</code> for details. 
		(Make note that -s options is always on and can not be turned off)
