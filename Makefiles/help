release:   Create all binaries      without debug code

all:       Create all binaries      with release code

rfs:       Create the client        with release code
rfsd:      Create the server daemon with release code
rfspasswd: Create the utility for storing the passwords within rfs-passwd

rfsdeb:    Create the debian package for the client
rfsddeb:   Create the debian package for the server
rpm:       Create the rpm packages for redhat/fedora
rpm-rfs:   Create the rpm rfs package for redhat/fedora
rpm-rfsd:  Create the rpm rfsd package for redhat/fedora

Creating binaries with an alternative compiler:
-----------------------------------------------

The following with compile with the Sun Studio Compiler
suite under Linux:
make release ALT=SunGcc
If you want to use the Intel Compiler, make sure that icc
is within your PATH and call;
make release ALT=Icc

The following with cross compile for an arm processor:
make release ALT=LS-GLv2

Build remotefs with new features as for example IPv6 support:
-------------------------------------------------------------

In order to include non standard features, edit the file
Makefiles/options.mk and uncomment the lines corresponding to
the feature you want to include.
If you want IPv6 support, remove the fisrt '#' from the line
